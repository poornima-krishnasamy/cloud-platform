# 21. Use SSO for CP Team to access AWS Console

Date: 2021-03-31

## Status

ðŸ¤” Proposed

## Proposal

We will enable AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) log-in to Cloud Platform AWS accounts. GitHub will be the SSO provider, meaning users enter their GitHub username/password/2FA during login (with Auth0 as OAuth2 broker). SSO will be configured to allow the `webops` GitHub team access to an administrative IAM Role.

This login method will be used by the Cloud Platform team to administer Cloud Platform's AWS accounts.

This method of authentication replaces using SAML login (also with GitHub).

## Context

Administrative access to the Cloud Platform's AWS account is used by the Cloud Platform team's engineers. This is so they can:

* access the AWS Console, to understand the AWS infrastructure and occasionally to do administrative actions (such as emergency restoring a backup EBS)
* authenticate on the command-line, to run 'terraform plan' while developing terraform changes, for example

Existing administrative access has been provided to these people like this:

* an IAM User is created for them using terraform, pull request, review
* they login to the console via SAML, with their GitHub account as the Identity Provider. Auth0 acts as a SAML broker, with Rules that ensures the user is a member of the ministryofjustice GitHub organization, and sets the AWS Role that can be assumed, corresponding to their GitHub teams. A couple of team members have not been able to get this method to work, and have been given username/password/MFA access instead.
* they use the console to create an access key, for use on the command-line

## Factors in the decision

Pros:

* SSO makes it easy to login to different roles and accounts without having to store different credentials. This may encourage using read-only role, rather than have full permissions all the time - a "least privilege" security benefit. And it makes it easier to administer other AWS accounts that use SSO, like DSD.
* SAML solution is flakey. A couple of people haven't been able to get the SAML method working, falling back to user a username/password. This is not ideal as the team have to remember to remove them in their leaver process, rather than being able to rely on the standard IT-managed leaver process that removes them from the GitHub organization.
* With SSO we don't have to create and remove IAM Users, like we did with SAML.
* Temporary AWS credentials are more secure than long-lived ones, and whilst this is already the case for console access, SSO provides this for command-line access too

Cons:

* The SSO login is only temporary before you login. It is currently set to 1h. TODO What is SAML login timeout? TODO should we increase it from 1h? TODO Can AWS Vault help with this?
* Ownership is not with the CP team any more - we need approval of the AWS organization root account to change the GitHub group(s) and their permissions. However admin permissions don't change much. And we can describe the [change in terraform](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/aws-root-account/blob/89c75d19663ce7d65588c3ee91cde724caba68c5/terraform/sso-admin-account-assignments.tf#L77-L86) so it really is just a PR approval we'd need.

TODO: Is this 2FA? Can/should we need that?

## How it will work

The proposed login works like this:

1. Users go to https://moj.awsapps.com/start#/ which redirects you to login.
2. Auth0 log-in selection page. User selects "Continue with GitHub".
3. GitHub login page. If already logged into GitHub, it's skipped.
4. AWS page to select account, role and either console or command-line access.
    For CP users their roles could be: AdministratorAccess or Readonly
5. Select either:

    **AWS Console** The user is logged in with a federated role, such as: `AWSReservedSSO_AdministratorAccess_bffb036637b86425/davidread@digital.justice.gov.uk`.
    After one hour, the console prompts you to "relogin", and a single click you're back in.

    OR

    **CLI** It shows commands to paste into a command-line, to set a temporary access key.
    After 1 hour they need to redo this from step 1.

Users may prefer the added convenience of using AWS Vault, which works like this:

1. User sets up a profile in their `.aws/config`:

        [profile cp]
        sso_start_url=https://moj.awsapps.com/start
        sso_region=eu-west-2
        sso_account_id=754256621582
        sso_role_name=AdministratorAccess

2. For **AWS Console**:

        aws-vault login cp

    OR for **CLI**:

        aws-vault exec cp -- aws s3 ls

    You have to click a link in the browser to login.

3. They are prompted for their storage password to save/retrieve a token (this is the case for MacOS keychain, and may differ for other secret storage mechanisms)

4. The browser will check you're logged into GitHub and invite you to click through an AWS login page. Both store cookies, so this step rarely needs doing after the first time.

Access for both Console and CLI expires after one hour. The user re-establishes the connection from the command again (step 2). TODO: check this is correct

## Decision

We enable SSO, as proposed. We'll transition our users to it and switch off SAML auth.

We will consider [requiring MFA at login](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-role.html#cli-configure-role-mfa)

We consider creating a 'readonly' role that can be used when possible, for safety.
